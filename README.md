## Overview

- FCNs and GCNs (1st order, 5th order, 8th order) were firstly used to classify time blocks of fmri data across subjects.
The fmri data came from the Camcan study (https://www.cam-can.org/) and was recorded while subjects watched a Hitchcock movie
Brain decoding.

A key goal in neuroscience is to understand brain mechanisms of cognitive functions. An emerging approach is “brain decoding ”, which consists of inferring a set of experimental conditions performed by a participant, using pattern classification of brain activity. Few works so far have attempted to train a brain decoding model that would generalize across many different cognitive tasks drawn from multiple cognitive domains. To tackle this problem, we proposed a multidomain brain decoder that automatically learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain response within a short time window using a deep learning approach. We evaluated the decoding model on a large population of 1200 participants, under 21 different experimental conditions spanning six different cog- nitive domains, acquired from the Human Connectome Project task-fMRI database. Using a 10s window of fMRI response, the 21 cognitive states were identified with a test accuracy of 90% (chance level 4.8%). Performance remained good when using a 6s window (82%).
