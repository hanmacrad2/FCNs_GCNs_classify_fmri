## Fully Connected & Graphical Neural Networks to classify fmri movie data 

Application of Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNs) & Graphical Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to fmri movie data. 

## Overview

The main results were ran in the notebook __1_fmri_gcns_main.ipynb.__
The models were run for block durations of 6, 8 and 16 to both filtered and filtered + normalised fmri data. The results obtained are as in the table below;
